Welcome to Group 44 repository for 22 fall Software Engineering homework 2 & 3!

This homework aims to port a program written in Lua (source) to Python while using good software engineering practices. The program reads a CSV file and generate summaries of columns (medians and standard deviation for numerics; mode and entropy for symbolic columns). This intends to read a CSV file and generate summaries of both numeric and symbolic columns, that is, medians and standard deviation for numeric columns, and mode and entropy for symbolic columns.

TEST CASES

Test cases are called by using pytest in python. Here the test cases in the test folder checks the coverage for the code written. Test cases work by calling all the functions in the code folder and checking if the input given matches with the result. If the condition is fulfilled than the test case is passed or else it is failed.
